Hello and thank you for checking out my little project, Video Game Recommender.

This program was intended to implement searching and sorting algorithms in python and I learned a lot while making it.

It's not a lot to look at and it's far from perfect. But it's a step in the right direction for someone trying to learn.

To begin, make sure that you have python installed and run the file called "vgr.py"
